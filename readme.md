## Taylor Deakin's Python Scripts

A collection of python scripts that I've written which others may find useful.

**Script List**

- PPT Extractor

### PPT Extractor

A script that converts powerpoint presentations to plain text. I created this to extract notes from lecture slides, but it may have other uses

#### Usage

`python ppt-extractor.py <filename>`

where `filename` is a powerpoint presentation. So far I have tested only .pptx files.
